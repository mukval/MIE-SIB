# MIE-SIB. Homework #1. 

### 1. Use tcpdump for analyzing sending time of packets. Calculate the time between packets and compare it with the settings of `tg` traffic generator.

 **1.** Perform traffic sending/receiving using two scripts mentioned in the task description.

 **2.** Run `tcpdump` for the traffic monitoring. Some paremeters should be specified. 
	
   **-i lo** - catch packets on local interface (server generates traffic for localhost and client detects traffic on localhost as well)
	
   **-tt** - convert time format to float numbers
	
   **dst port 4133** - dump only packets from server to client
	
   **-l** do not use buffer 
	
Output of `tcpdump` is sending to the pattern scanning language `mawk` (awk analog). Where it is processed - interval between packets and average value of it are calculated

	tcpdump -tt -l -i lo dst port 4133 | mawk -Winteractive 'count {diff=$1-prev; sum+=diff; 
		print count". diff="$1-prev" avg="sum/count}; {prev=$1; count++}'

**3.** Results are shown in Figure.

350 packets were captured and analyzed. **Grey bars** are time interval between current and previos packet. **Red line** is a value from settings of traffic generator. *Blue curve* - average value of time intervals amoung measurement. 

As we can see the blue curve converges to the red line.

### 2. Use tcpdump for traffic dumping. Calculate the size of packets and compare it with the setting of `tg` traffic generator.

 **1.** Perform traffic sending/receiving using two scripts mentioned in the task description.

 **2.** Run `tcpdump` for the traffic monitoring. Some paremeters should be specified. 

   **-i lo** - catch packets on local interface (server generates traffic for localhost and client detects traffic on localhost as well)
	
   **dst port 4133** - dump only packets from server to client
	
   **-l** do not use buffer 
	
Output of `tcpdump` is sending to the pattern scanning language `mawk` (awk analog). Where it is processed - packet length and average value of it are calculated

	tcpdump -l -i lo dst port 4133 | mawk -Winteractive 'count {sum+=$21; 
		print count". length="$21" avg="sum/count}; {count++}'

**3.** Results are shown in Figure.

![Packet length](https://github.com/platomik/MIE-SIB/raw/master/homework2/packetlength.jpg)

500 packets were captured and analyzed. **Grey bars** are size of packets. **Red line** is a value from settings of traffic generator. *Blue curve* - average packets size values. 

### 3. Develop program for a web traffic generation.

From the article *Hyoung-Kee Choi, John O. Limb, A Behavioral Model of Web Traffic"* we have the parameters and their expected distributions used to model the Web traffic.
