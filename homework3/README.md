### 1. Histogram of time between flows.

File [tmp.flw](https://github.com/platomik/MIE-SIB/blob/master/homework3/tmp.flw "tmp.flw"). was generated by plugin Nfsen2R. It includes traffic flows for half-day interval. And looks like:

	DATE,SOURCE,DESTINATION,PROTO,SPORT,DPORT,INPUT,OUTPUT,DURATION,FLAGS
	2012-12-21 23:58:50.202,    173.45.67.98,   78.46.229.109,TCP  ,  4287,    80,       6,       0,    0.302,.AP.SF
	2012-12-21 23:58:50.202,   78.46.229.109,    173.45.67.98,TCP  ,    80,  4287,       7,       0,    0.302,.AP.SF
	2012-12-21 23:58:58.655,   78.46.229.109,    173.45.67.98,TCP  ,    80,  1139,       7,       0,    0.300,.AP.SF
	....

Let's build a histogram for time between adjacent flows in the file.
